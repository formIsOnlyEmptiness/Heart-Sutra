The Bodhisattva of Compassion, When he meditated deeply, Saw the emptiness of all five
skandhas
And sundered the bonds that caused
him suffering.
Here then,
Form is no other than emptiness, Emptiness no other than form. Form is only emptiness, Emptiness only form.
Feeling, thought, and choice, Consciousness itself,
Are the same as this.

All things are by nature void They are not born or destroyed Nor are they stained or pure Nor do they wax or wane
So, in emptiness, no form,
No feeling, thought, or choice, Nor is there consciousness.
No eye, ear, nose, tongue, body,
mind;
No colour, sound, smell, taste,
touch,
Or what the mind takes hold of, Nor even act of sensing.
